# Environments and Channels

Runtime targets, release audiences, and risk lanes.

---

## Environments

Runtime targets. Where something runs.

| Environment | Purpose | Deployment |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | Fast iteration | Automatic from `main` |
| **Staging** | Candidate validation | Manual or gated promotion |
| **Production** | Live traffic | Gated promotion from staging |

### Rules

- Environments are deployment targets, not git branches
- Same artifact moves across environments
- Config differs by environment; code does not

## Channels

Release audience and risk lanes. Who gets something and how risky it is.

Channels are **quality-gated** — a build gets promoted when it passes checks, not on a schedule.

| Channel | Exposure | Ceremony | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | Team only | Low — may track every merge | All |
| **Canary** | Limited production users | Medium — requires objective checks | Tier 3 |
| **Beta** | Opt-in or limited audience | Medium — versioned prereleases | Tier 2+ |
| **Stable** | General availability | High — tagged, noted, published | All |

### Channel Sets by Tier

| Tier | Channels | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Solo / Personal** | `dev` + `stable` | No users to protect with intermediate gates |
| **Solo / Consultancy** | `dev` + `beta` + `stable` | Beta gives clients a preview; no traffic to split for canary |
| **Small Team** | `dev` + `canary` + `beta` + `stable` | Full model — canary enables low-blast-radius production validation |

### Mapping Versions to Channels

- Every merge to `main` → dev build
- Selected builds → canary (Tier 3)
- Versioned prereleases (`-beta.N`, `-rc.N`) → beta
- Approved tags → stable

### What About Nightly?

Nightly is a **time-gated build schedule**, not a quality-gated channel. If you produce nightly builds, they feed into `dev` or `canary`. The build cadence is a CI concern; the channel model is a delivery concern.

### Rules

- Canary is limited exposure
- Stable is default public release
- Dev is not guaranteed stable
- Promotion requires objective checks

## The Distinction

Environments answer: **where is this running?**
Channels answer: **who gets this and how risky is it?**

A staging environment might host a release candidate. Production might host both canary and stable deployments. Internal builds may go to a dev environment but not be formal releases. Keep them separate.
