# Artifacts

Immutable build outputs, build identity, release identity, and the promotion model.

## Treat Artifacts as First-Class Citizens

### Build Identity vs. Release Identity

An artifact carries two layers of identity:

**Build identity** is baked in at build time. It never changes.

- Commit SHA
- Build timestamp
- Build number / pipeline ID
- Provenance if possible

**Release identity** is assigned later, at promotion time. It lives outside the artifact.

- Semantic version (`1.6.0`)
- Channel label (`stable`, `beta`)
- Release notes, changelog entry

At build time, the artifact does not know whether it will become `v1.6.0` or get abandoned. The build identity is all it can embed. The release identity is layered on at promotion time.

### What the User Sees

The version displayed to the user depends on the deployment context, not just what is baked into the artifact.

**The pattern:** embed build identity in the artifact, resolve release identity from the deployment context at runtime.

| Source | What it provides | When it is known |
|---|---|---|
| Embedded in artifact | Commit SHA, build number, build timestamp | Build time |
| Deployment context | Release version, channel label | Promotion / deploy time |
| Display to user | Composed from both | Runtime |

**Deployment context** means: environment variable, sidecar metadata file, container label, package manifest, installer metadata, config endpoint, or similar. The mechanism varies by product type, but the principle is constant — the artifact reads its release identity from the context it is deployed into, not from its own binary.

### What the user sees by channel

| Channel | Version display | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | Build identity only | `build 847 (abc1234)` or `0.0.0-dev+abc1234` |
| **Beta** | Prerelease version | `1.6.0-beta.2` |
| **Stable** | Release version | `1.6.0` |

Dev users see build coordinates. That is normal and expected — they are on the bleeding edge and the build has no release identity yet. Stable users see a clean semantic version because the deployment context provides it.

### How to Provide Deployment Context

The exact mechanism depends on product type:

| Product type | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Server / container | Environment variable or sidecar file injected at deploy time |
| CLI tool | Version file or metadata baked into the distribution package (not the binary) |
| Desktop app | Installer or update manifest carries the version |
| Mobile app | App store metadata + build number |
| Library / package | Package manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) |

For libraries and packages, the package manifest **is** the deployment context — it is updated at promotion time before publishing, and the code reads the version from it at runtime.

### Composing the Display Version

At runtime, the application composes what it shows the user:

```
if deployment_context has release_version:
    display = release_version           # "1.6.0"
else:
    display = build_identity            # "build 847 (abc1234)"
```

Optionally, always include build identity in detailed views (e.g., "About" dialogs):

```
Version:  1.6.0
Build:    847
Commit:   abc1234
Built:    2026-03-28T14:22:00Z
```

This gives users and support teams full traceability without breaking artifact immutability.

### Traceability Without Release Notes

Stable releases have changelogs and release notes. Dev channel builds do not — but they are still fully traceable.

Given a build identity, anyone can reconstruct what changed:

```
git log <previous-sha>..abc1234 --oneline
```

Conventional commit messages serve as the summary: `feat: add export command`, `fix: prevent null crash in importer`. The git history **is** the feature list for dev builds.

The framework guarantees that every build is traceable to its source via the embedded commit SHA. How teams surface that information to testers — Slack bots, CI dashboards, deployment notifications, or just asking in standup — is a team communication concern, not a workflow concern. The framework provides the traceability; the team chooses the mechanism.

### Examples

| Type | Format |
|---|---|
| Docker image | `sha-abc1234`, aliased to `1.6.0` and `stable` at promotion |
| CLI binary | `tool-sha-abc1234-linux-amd64.zip`, aliased to `tool-v1.6.0-linux-amd64.zip` |
| Python wheel | Built with version `0.0.0-dev`, published with version `1.6.0` in package index |
| Installer | Wraps the same binary; installer metadata carries the release version |
| Mobile build | Build number is permanent; version string updated in store metadata |

### Rules

- Artifacts are immutable
- Build identity is embedded at build time and never changes
- Release identity is provided by the deployment context, not embedded in the artifact
- Artifacts are traceable to commit, tag, and pipeline
- Artifacts are retained long enough for rollback and audit

### Identity

| Identifier | What it tracks | When assigned |
|---|---|---|
| Git commit | Source | Commit time |
| Build identity | Artifact provenance | Build time |
| Tag | Release intent | Promotion time |
| Alias | Release identity on the artifact | Promotion time |

These are related but not identical. The gap between build time and promotion time is where the aliasing model lives.

## The Promotion Model

**Build once, promote many.** This is one of the strongest patterns you can adopt.

Do not rebuild separately for staging and production if you can avoid it.

```
1. Commit merges to main
2. CI builds artifact once
3. Artifact gets a unique build ID / commit SHA
4. Deploy artifact to dev
5. Promote same artifact to staging
6. Promote same artifact to canary
7. Promote same artifact to stable
```

You are testing and promoting **the same thing**, not similar things.

### Promotion Is Aliasing, Not Rebuilding

The artifact produced at build time is the **only** artifact. Promotion adds new pointers to it — it never triggers a new build.

When a dev build gets promoted to stable:

```
1. Commit abc1234 merges to main
2. CI builds artifact: myapp:sha-abc1234
3. Artifact deploys to dev channel
4. Team validates the build
5. Tag the commit: v1.6.0
6. Alias the existing artifact under the release version:
   - Docker:  docker tag myapp:sha-abc1234 myapp:1.6.0
   - Binary:  copy or link tool-sha-abc1234.zip → tool-v1.6.0.zip
   - Package: publish same bits under version 1.6.0
7. Update channel pointer (e.g., myapp:stable → myapp:1.6.0)
8. Generate changelog and release notes from the tag
```

The bytes are identical. The checksum matches. The version tag, channel label, and release notes are **metadata layered on top** of an immutable artifact — not a reason to rebuild it.

### What the Promotion Pipeline Does

A promotion pipeline is lightweight. It does not compile, test, or package source code. It:

- Tags the git commit with the release version
- Aliases the artifact in the registry / storage under the version name
- Updates the channel pointer (stable, beta, etc.)
- Generates changelog and release notes
- Publishes release metadata (GitHub Release, package index, etc.)

### What the Promotion Pipeline Does Not Do

- Rebuild from source
- Rerun tests against source (smoke tests against the deployed artifact are fine)
- Produce a new artifact with different bytes
- Change the artifact's embedded commit SHA or build timestamp

If promotion requires a rebuild, something is wrong with the build process. Fix the build, do not work around it by rebuilding at promotion time.
