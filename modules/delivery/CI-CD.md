# CI and CD

Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and rollback.

---

## CI Is About Trust

CI answers: **"Is this change good enough to integrate?"**

| Step | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Format / lint | Code quality |
| Unit tests | Correctness |
| Integration tests | System behavior |
| Static analysis | Safety |
| Build / package | Artifact creation |
| Generate artifacts | Deliverables |
| Preview builds | Early feedback |

---

## CD Is About Movement

CD answers: **"Can we safely move this artifact through environments and channels?"**

| Step | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Deploy to environment | Runtime placement |
| Smoke tests | Basic validation |
| Gate promotion | Confidence checkpoint |
| Rollback support | Safety net |
| Publish release notes | Communication |
| Publish binaries | Distribution |

---

## CI on Merge to Main

- Build artifact
- Assign build metadata
- Publish internal artifact
- Deploy automatically to dev
- Run smoke tests

---

## Rollback

- Rollback by redeploying the prior artifact or tag
- Never patch production manually
- Never rebuild old source for rollback if the old artifact exists

Rollback is a deployment operation, not a source control operation.
