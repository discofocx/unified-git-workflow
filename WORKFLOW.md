# Workflow

Day-to-day development: branching, PRs, commits, issues, and merges.

---

## Development Model

**Trunk-based development with short-lived branches.**

- `main` is the integration branch and the source of truth
- Feature branches are short-lived
- Merge often
- Avoid long-running release branches unless you truly need parallel supported versions

This ages much better than classic GitFlow for modern CI/CD-heavy work.

---

## Branching

### Rules

- No long-lived feature branches
- One branch, one concern
- Branch names must map to issues
- Delete the branch immediately after merge

### Naming

Keep it boring and systematic. Include the issue ID when possible.

```
feature/123-add-user-search
fix/287-null-check-on-login
chore/315-upgrade-openapi-generator
spike/333-evaluate-rust-parser
hotfix/401-fix-prod-timeout
```

Prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `spike/`, `hotfix/`

---

## Pull Requests

### Rules

When PRs are used (Tier 2 and Tier 3 — see [Adapting](ADAPTING.md)):

- PR must explain **why**, not just what
- PR must link an issue
- PR must pass CI
- PR must be reviewable in one sitting
- PRs older than a few days should be reconsidered or split

**Tier 1 (Solo / Personal):** PRs are optional. Useful for self-review on larger changes, but direct commits to `main` are acceptable for small, well-understood changes.

**Tier 2 (Solo / Consultancy):** PRs required. Self-review is the norm, but the audit trail matters for client accountability.

**Tier 3 (Small Team):** PRs required. Peer review by another human is the point.

### A PR Should Be

- Small enough to review
- Tied to an issue
- Passing CI
- Mergeable without ambiguity
- Squashed or rebased cleanly

### Merge Policy

**Squash merge by default** for feature and fix branches. It keeps `main` readable.

Branch is deleted immediately after merge.

---

## Commits

### Convention

Use conventional commits or something close:

```
feat: add export command
fix: prevent null crash in importer
chore: upgrade ruff config
docs: clarify release process
```

Conventional commits enable automated changelogs and release notes. Versioning and release notes should be **derived from changes**, not invented at the end.

### Prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `chore` | Maintenance, tooling, dependencies |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |

---

## Issues

### Types

Use a small taxonomy:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Feature** | New capability |
| **Bug** | Something broken |
| **Chore** | Maintenance, upgrades, housekeeping |
| **Spike** | Research or investigation |
| **Release** | Release coordination |
| **Incident** | Production issue |

### Lifecycle

```
Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Verified → Done
```

### Traceability

- Every PR points to an issue
- Every release summarizes included issues
- Every hotfix links back to the incident

That gives you traceability without enterprise theater.

---

## CI on PR

CI validates every change before it reaches `main`.

- Format / lint
- Unit tests
- Integration tests where feasible
- Build validation
- Static analysis
- Preview artifact if relevant

CI should answer: **"Is this change good enough to integrate?"**

## Doctrine

The rules, collected. Rules marked with a tier apply from that tier upward.

| # | Rule | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No long-lived feature branches | All |
| 2 | One branch, one concern | All |
| 3 | Use conventional commits | All |
| 4 | Rebase or squash before merge | All |
| 5 | `main` is always the source of truth | All |
| 6 | No direct commits to `main` (except small changes in Tier 1) | Tier 2+ |
| 7 | Branch names must map to issues | Tier 2+ |
| 8 | PR required for every change | Tier 2+ |
| 9 | PR must explain why, not just what | Tier 2+ |
| 10 | PR must link an issue | Tier 2+ |
| 11 | PR must pass CI | Tier 2+ |
| 12 | PR must be reviewable in one sitting | Tier 2+ |
| 13 | PRs older than a few days should be reconsidered or split | Tier 2+ |
| 14 | Peer review required (not just self-review) | Tier 3 |
